<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Complete.It

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

We built <strong>Complete.It</strong> to help you properly manage your tasks and increase productivity on a daily basis! We understand the challenges and overcomplications that can be found with many existing task managements systems, and we designed <strong>Complete.It</strong> with a minimalistic and effective interface that strategically maximizes your organizational success.

Below, we describe in detail the practices and styling that we emphasized during our design and development process. 
<strong>Complete.It</strong> was envisioned and developed with the following frameworks and technology stack:
* We prioritized incorporating the fundamental tools available in <strong>Angular</strong>, including routes, directives, services, data binding, and HTTP requests.
* With <strong>Flask</strong> and Python 3.8, we implemented REST API endpoints for user authentication and integration with MongoDB collections for performing CRUD operations.
* We established a NoSQL database model with <strong>MongoDB</strong> and managed multiple collections of information.
* We deployed our application frontend and backend to a cloud platform using <strong>Heroku</strong>, and built skills in deployment configuration and DevOps.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
