## About

![Complete.It Screenshot](images/CompleteItImage.JPG)

We built <strong>Complete.It</strong> to help you properly manage your tasks and increase productivity on a daily basis! We understand the challenges and overcomplications that can be found with many existing task managements systems, and we designed <strong>Complete.It</strong> with a minimalistic and effective interface that strategically maximizes your organizational success.

Below, we describe in detail the practices and styling that we emphasized during our design and development process. 
<strong>Complete.It</strong> was envisioned and developed with the following frameworks and technology stack:
* We prioritized incorporating the fundamental tools available in <strong>Angular</strong>, including routes, directives, services, data binding, and HTTP requests.
* With <strong>Flask</strong> and Python 3.8, we implemented REST API endpoints for user authentication and integration with MongoDB collections for performing CRUD operations.
* We established a NoSQL database model with <strong>MongoDB</strong> and managed multiple collections of information.
* We deployed our application frontend and backend to a cloud platform using <strong>Heroku</strong>, and built skills in deployment configuration and DevOps.

Through the engineering design and implementation process, we have gained an advanced knowledge of industry-leading technologies and applied them to create a minimalistic and effective utility product. We have interwoven our skillsets of front-end and back-end frameworks to produce an application that reduces the time necessary to implement and manage your personal productivity pipeline.
